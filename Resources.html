					To play Dungeons and Dragons you're going to need some character sheets! 
				<br>
					Here's a PDF you can download, print out and fill in.
				<br>
					<link><a href="Battlemaps/D&DCharacterSheet.pdf"> Character Sheets</a>
				<br>
				<br>
					We also have a few maps you can print off on A4 paper and use to play.
				<br>
					<link><a href="Battlemaps/Grass.pdf">Battle Map 1</a>
				<br>
					<link><a href="Battlemaps/Dirt.pdf">Battle Map 2</a>
				<br>
					<link><a href="Battlemaps/Stone.pdf">Battle Map 3</a>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
					If you don't know how to fill in a character sheet, here's how.
				<br>
				<br>
					First choose a race and class. 
				<br>
					These are listed in their respective webpages.
				<br>
				<br>
					Now let's get the six main statistics. To get these you need to roll four six-sided dice.
				<br>
					Then add up the three largest numbers of those four dice.
				<br>
					Do this six times.
				<br>
					Once you have these six numbers you can then decide where you want to put these numbers in this part of the character sheet.
				<br>
					<img src="Images/SIXSTAT.png" alt="Character sheet with the six main stats circled" width="50%">
				<br>
					Now to work out the bonus for each stat by using this table.
				<br>
					<img src="Images/ABILMOD.png" alt="Table of ability modifiers">
				<br>
				<br>
					Then you can fill in this part by colouring in each circle by the skills you are proficient in.
				<br>
					<img src="Images/PROF.png" alt="Character sheet with the skills and saving throws circled" width="50%">
				<br>
				<br>
					You can find out what skills you are proficient in by going to the classes page.
				<br> 
					Then on the line beside each stat you put the ability modifier and add the proficiency bonus if necessary.
				<br>
				<br>
					Use this table to figure out your proficiency bonus.
				<br>
					<img src="Images/PROFTABLE.png" alt="Table of proficiency bonuses">
				<br>
				<br>
					Next we'll fill in your passive perception, armour class and initiative modifier.<br>These are located here on the character sheet.
				<br>
					<img src="Images/ARMOUR.png" alt="Character sheet with armour class, initiative and speed circled" width="50%">
				<br>
				<br> 
					Your passive perception is ten plus your wisdom modifier.<br> Your armour class is ten plus your dexterity, this can be increased by using armour.<br>Your initiative modifier is your dexterity modifier, this is then added onto your initiative roll when you play.
				<br>
				<br>
					Now we'll fill in your speed, hit points and hit dice.
				<br>
				<br>
					Your speed depends on what race your character is. You can choose one in the <link><a href="Races.html">races page</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
					Your hit points and hit dice depend on what class you have chosen. You can choose a class in the <link><a href="Classas.html">classes page</a>.
				<br>
				<br> 
					Finally, we will fill in your attack bonuses for each weapon you have. We fill this in here.
				<br>
					<img src="Images/WEAPONS.png" alt="Character sheet with attacks and spellcasting section circled" width="50%">
				<br>
					You can choose different weapons that are available to your class, these are listed in the <link><a href="Classas.html">classes page</a>. Each weapon is associated with either strength or dexterity.
				<br>
					You add the ability modifier associated with your weapon and your proficiency bonus together, that is your attack bonus for your weapon. 
				<br>
				<br>
					Now you have the complicated part of your character sheet filled in. The rest is up to you.
