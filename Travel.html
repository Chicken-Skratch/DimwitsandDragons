						This page has a few rules about traveling in dungeons and dragons as well as rules for activities outside of combat.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size:large; color:#1B1B1B; text-align:center">
						<b>Currency</b>
					<br>
						The currency in dungeons and dragons consists of four main coins; Copper, Silver, Gold and Platinum.
					<br>
						One platinum coin is worth ten gold coins. One gold coin is worth ten silver coins. One silver coin is worth ten copper coins.
					<br>
						The coin you would most commonly use is the gold coin. For a reference of value, a gold coin would be able to buy a bedroll and 50-feet of rope.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Travel Pace</b>
					<br>
						When traveling you can travel at a slow pace, fast pace or a normal pace. 
					<br>
						Traveling at a normal pace will let you cover three miles every hour.
					<br>
						Traveling at a fast pace will let you cover four miles every hour, but you will have a -5 penalty to your passive perception; making it harder to notice certain things for example, an ambush.
					<br>
						Traveling at a slow pace will let you cover two miles every hour, but you are able to use stealth so that you are harder to detect by enemies or other creatures.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Your Environment</b>
					<br>
						If you fall from a height such as falling off a cliff you take 1d6 of bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet that you fall.
					<br>
						If your character falls and takes damage they are knocked prone, but if they avoid taking damage they will not be knocked prone. They can avoid taking damage by succeeding with a saving throw to catch themselves.
					<br>
					<br>
						A character is able to hold their breath for a number of minutes that is equal to 1 + your constitution modifier with a minimum of 30 seconds. For example, if your constitution modifier is +2 you can hold your breath for three minutes; but if your constitution modifier is -2 you can hold your breath for 30 seconds.
					<br>
						When you do run out of breath you can survive for a number of rounds that is equal to your constitution modifier for example if your constitution modifier is +2 you will survive two rounds before dropping to zero hit points.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Vision and Light</b>
					<br>
						There are different levels of lighting you can encounter in dungeons and dragons these are bright light, dim light and darkness.
					<br>
						Bright light is standard lighting that you would have during the day or in a well lit room. Most dungeons and dragons races can see clearly in this light.
					<br>
						Dim light is the lighting you would get if the moon was very bright at night time or if you were in in a shaded area during the day. All dungeons and dragons races are able to see in dim light.
					<br>
						Darkness is the lighting you would get at night time or in a dungeon with no lights. A few dungeons and dragons races are unable to see in darkness.
					<br>
					<br>
						In dungeons and dragons an area can be obscured to the players. They can be lightly obscured or heavily obscured.
					<br>
						An area can be lightly obscured by dim light or by light fog. This will give the player a disadvantage on perception checks if they are relying on sight.
					<br>
						An area can be heavily obscured by darkness or dense fog. This will make the player unable to see and so they will fail any ability checks that involve sight as well as have disadvantage on any attack rolls while enemies will have advantage on attack rolls against them.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Resting</b>
					<br>
						When adventuring a player can take a short or long rest.
					<br>
						A short rest lasts at least one hour in which the character cannot do anything that is more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading or tending to wounds. During a short rest a character can roll their hit dice to regain hit points.
					<br>
						A long rest lasts at least eight hours in which a character can sleep or perform a light activity such as eating, drinking or reading. If the rest is interrupted by strenuous activity such as fighting or casting spells, the character cannot gain any benefit and must begin the rest again.
					<br>
						A long rest will restore your hit points and regain half or your hit dice. You can only gain the benefits of a long rest once every 24 hours and you must have at least 1 hit point to gain any benefits.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Exhaustion</b>
					<br>
						Exhaustion can affect your characters if they have not slept, eaten or drank for 24 hours or if they have experienced extreme temperatures for a long period of time. Some special abilities or environmental hazards can also cause exhaustion.
					<br>
						If your character is exhausted and they perform an action that will make them exhausted, such as not sleeping for two days in a row, they will gain another level of exhaustion. There are a total of six levels of exhaustion.
					<br>
					<br>
						Level one gives your character disadvantage of ability checks.
					<br>
						Level two halves your character's speed.
					<br>
						Level three gives your character disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.
					<br>
						Level four halves your character's hit point maximum.
					<br>
						Level five reduces your character's speed to zero.
					<br>
						If you reach level six of exhaustion, it will kill your character.
					<br>
					<br>
						You can reduce the level of exhaustion by one level for each long rest your character takes.
