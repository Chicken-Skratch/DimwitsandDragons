						<b>The Battlemap</b>
					<br>
						The battle map is usually made up of 1-inch squares, although this can differ. 
					<br>
						Each square represents 5 feet in the game. So if your movement speed was 30 you would be able to move 6 squares on the battle map.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Turns in combat</b>
					<br>
						It is important to note that each turn in combat lasts 6 seconds meaning a minute is 10 rounds of combat.
					<br>
						This is important because certain actions such as donning armour or casting spells take a certain amount of time so players need to keep this in mind when in combat.
					<br>
					<br>
						A turn in combat is comprised of an action, movement, bonus action, reaction, and interaction. Each have different uses during combat such as an interaction which is a simple action that would not take a full action or bonus action to do such as picking up a small item or pulling out your weapon.

					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Using Your Action</b>
					<br>
						As an action you are able to attack, cast a spell, dash, disengage, dodge, help, hide, ready search or use an object. Now we'll explain some of the hard to understand ones.
					<br>
					<br>
						When you use your action to dash, your movement is doubled but you cannot attack. This is useful if you are running away from an enemy.
					<br>
					<br>
						Using your action to disengage makes it so that when you move past enemies they cannot get opportunity attacks against you.
					<br>
					<br>
						The dodge action gives disadvantage to any attack rolls against your character if they can see the attacker.
					<br>
					<br>
						The help action is when you help an ally complete a task such as moving a rock. You do not roll but instead you give the other player character advantage on their roll.
					<br>
					<br>
						The ready action is when you prepare an action to be used in a certain circumstance for example you could ready your action to attack someone when they come out of hiding.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Combat Order</b>
					<br>
						In combat the order of which each person takes their turn is determined by a roll that is known as initiative. Each person rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier, whoever has the highest total roll goes first and whoever has the lowest goes last.
					<br>
					<br>
						Another thing that determines the order of combat is surprise. If the players are stealthing when they enter combat they are likely to surprise the enemy, this means that the enemies that are surprised cannot attack for this round but will be able to in later rounds.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Zero Hit Points and Death Saves</b>
					<br>
						When you drop to zero hit points in combat you are unconscious. You then have to make death saving throws to see if you will live or die.
					<br>
					<br>
						A death is made by rolling a d20 with no modifiers. If you get above ten you succeed, below ten and you fail. If you roll a natural 1 you fail two death saves, but if you roll a natural 20 you regain a hit point. If you take damage while on 0 hit points you fail a death save.
					<br>
					<br>
						You need to fail three times to die and to regain consciousness you need to succeed three death saves or be healed.
					<br>
					<br>
						You are able to die instantly in combat if the damage you have taken exceeds your maximum hit points and your current hit points. For example, if your hit point maximum was 10 and you were on 4 hit points, if you took 15 points of damage you would die instantly.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Making an attack</b>
					<br>
						When making an attack you choose your target, determine what modifiers you add to your attack and then roll for the attack.
					<br>
					<br>
						When you make an attack you first make an attack roll using the d20 you see if the attack hits or misses. You then roll the damage dice for the weapon being used you add the ability modifier for the weapon onto the damage.
					<br>
					<br>
						Attacking with a spell can be different. Some spells you do not need to make an attack roll, instead the opponent makes a saving throw to see if the spell hits them.
					<br>
					<br>
						There are also opportunity attacks where you can use your reaction to attack an enemy that exits your attack range.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Cover</b>
					<br>
						Cover is an aspect of combat that make it more difficult for someone to hit their target if their target is behind an object like a wall.
					<br>
					<br>
						If the target is half obscured by an object they are considered half covered and get a +2 bonus to their armour class and dexterity saving throws.
					<br>
					<br>
						A target can also be in three-quarters cover, this gives them a +5 bonus to their armour class and dexterity saving throws.
					<br>
					<br>
						Finally, there is full cover. This is when a target is completely concealed by an obstacle and cannot be hit unless it is an area of effect attack like a fireball spell.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Difficult Terrain</b>
					<br>
						Difficult terrain is when your movement is halved due to the ground being hard to walk on. 
					<br>
						This could be because there are a lot of plants on the ground to step over or you could be walking on ice and have to go slow or risk falling prone.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b>Prone</b>
					<br>
						During a fight your character could become prone, this means they are on the ground.
					<br>
					<br>
						When prone enemies have advantage on melee attacks against you while ranged attacks have disadvantage.
					<br>
					<br>
						You can use half of your movement to stand up again in combat.
